## [](https://github.com/bunkercoin-project/bunkercoin/tree/master#what-is-bunkercoin)What is Bunkercoin?

Bunkercoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Bunkercoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.

## Usage 

To start your journey with Bunkercoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Bunkercoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `bunkercoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `bunkercoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.
